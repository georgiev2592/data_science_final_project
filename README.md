Final Project
====

In the final project for this course, you will apply the techniques learned in this class to analyze a data set of interest to you. Your goal should be to create an original project that you would be proud to show off to a potential employer. You are encouraged to upload your project to Github after the course is over.

### Requirements
The outline below is only a suggestion. If you have a completely different idea for a data science project that does not fit neatly with the following requirements, please come talk to me.

- The data that you analyze should be complex to collect or to clean in some way.
- You should create informative visualizations to explain the data and your findings.
- You should use machine learning to build a model to predict some outcome variable in your data set.
You are expected to work on this project in pairs, although you can work individually if you prefer. Please note that if you work alone, you are still expected to produce the same amount of work as a two-person team.

### Deliverables
- A directory containing the following notebooks:
- - Data Collection and Cleaning: This notebook should contain all code that you wrote to collect and clean the data.
- - Data Exploration: This notebook should contain all code that you wrote as you were exploring the data. It should contain results and visualizations.
- - Machine Learning: This notebook should contain the code that you wrote to determine what model to fit and to analyze the performance of the model you ultimately chose.
- - Presentation: This is a notebook containing just the highlights from your analyses above. It should not contain much code, unless the code is important for understanding the analysis.
- A 5-10 minute in-class presentation about your findings.
